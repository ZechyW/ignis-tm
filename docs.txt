an irish athletics year wont be remembered as one of irish athletics great years the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad but come late august few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics or to be more accurate the lack of it sonia osullivans olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers but after the disastrous build-up to the games we shouldnt have been surprised at the start of the year an osullivan had been earmarked as irelands best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury less than week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned_substance epo lombards shattering of mark carrolls national 10,000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed two-year ban from the sport back at pre-olympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things couldnt have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in car crash near athens once the track and field action began in athens familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair craggs performance in being the only athlete from european nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future our beloved sonia scraped into the womens 5k final as fastest loser and for couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over minute behind winner meseret defar it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from stomach bug in the hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness amazingly she was back in action couple of weeks later when beating world-class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over its unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition at least sonia managed to make it to athens at the start of the year several northern_ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an out-of-form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province the ballymena man gave it lash but his achilles problem and bad lane draw meant time of and an early exit james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane the injury-plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter lingering hamstring probem and virus wrecked mckees athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve slice of better fortune in pole vaulter brown had hoped for vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens standard but the call never came as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years donnelly and his annadale striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on december large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andys many friends as only death can it put the years athletics happenings in sharp perspective
analysis no pain no gain he called it his masochism strategy in the run-up to the iraq_war and now tony_blair has signed up for another dose of pain the idea is simple the prime_minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of real voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras the theory is that talking to the great british public even if they are the great unwashed is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real peoples concerns and on occasions of their outright fury mr blair used the tactic before the iraq_war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin control freakery and over-slick presentation sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps tony_blair himself has said people complain he does not listen mr blairs latest bout of flagellation came with series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday the trouble began on the wright stuff show with maria hutchings marching up to him saying tony thats rubbish as she tried to complain about her autistic sons school being threatened with closure few dont worries as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted public slanging match he spoke to her privately after the show but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce writer neil coppendale from west sussex asked of the iraq_war tens_of_thousands of innocent men women and children died how do you manage to sleep at night on immigration london teacher diane granger said where are you going to put everyone and can you imagine even jeremy paxman putting the question posed by brighton nurse marion brown would you wipe somebodys backside for mr blair tried to use the questioners first names and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems many of the newspapers have branded the exercise pr stunt which backfired indeed there is danger mr blair simply ends up looking embattled conservative michael_howard and liberal_democrat charles_kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become story and the real issues take prominence james humphreys ex-head of corporate communications at number says the strategy shows frustration with the media they feel they dont get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion he says there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls he argues the prime_minister knows full well the potential hazards he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the election campaign all you do is walk around and make yourself known you dont do anything to help anybody she told mr blair before stomping off refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately former downing_street media chief alastair_campbell has described the episode as bit of disaster as it meant the launch of labours election manifesto received little coverage but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive not least because it coincided with john prescotts even more direct contact when he punched an egg-throwing protester former prime_ministers too have come to grief at the hands of persistent member of the public the undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was margaret_thatcher discomfort on nationwide in when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the election campaign with his famous soapbox it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added fizz to his campaign in his memoirs he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnocks contrived photo opportunities and attempts at an artful campaign he wanted to look like prime_minister was prime_minister and wanted flesh and blood fight says mr major mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could enthuse and engage and give the public sense of empowerment but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim no pain no gain

army chiefs in regiments decision military chiefs are expected to meet to make final decision on the future of scotlands army regiments committee of the army board which is made up of the most senior defence figures will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on monday the proposals include cutting scotlands six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into super_regiment the plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike the committees decision must be ratified by defence secretary geoff hoon and prime_minister tony_blair it is expected that it will be made public next week when ministers announced reorganisation of the army it drew question mark over the futures of the black watch the kings own scottish borderers the royal scots the royal highland fusiliers and the argyll and sutherland highlanders in october the council of scottish colonels proposed the merger of the royal scots and the kings own scottish borderers into single battalion under their vision it would be one of five in the new super_regiment the proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into super_regiment sparked political outcry with labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan they felt the timing was insensitive because the black watch was in the frontline in iraq suffering casualties the save the scottish regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against labour at the next general_election speaking ahead of the expected army board meeting spokesman said the government and the army board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the scottish regiments are for the good of the army and for that of the serving soldier they are very much not for the good and will destroy scotlands regiments by moulding them into single super_regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems loss of local connections to those regiments and loss to scotland of an important part of her heritage and most importantly her future the regiments are the envy of armies around the world an alternative blueprint had been put forward by labour mp eric joyce who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments for brief time there was speculation the prime_minister might consider the plan but that now seems unlikely speaking in scotland last week mr blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce more effective structure and hinted that super_regiment was likely he said they dont want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections far from it all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly the prime_minister said he hoped campaigners concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount

athens memories soar above lows well its goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens obviously theres no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly_holmes and paula_radcliffe but want to remind you of few more events that made another year to remember or forget for athletics one of my favourite olympic moments was kellys success in the 800m winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be bit of formality kelly had been full of should shouldnt thoughts about going for the double in athens thought why wouldnt you do the 800m its your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story the victory for the british mens 4x100m_relay team was bit of surprise but great climax to the games think the four of them jason_gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark_lewis-francis knew deep down that it was their best chance of medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake hicham_el guerroujs olympic double is much bigger achievement than kellys on global scale he was the first man since for years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles as soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and had finished commentating jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone enjoy having bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce very dramatic ending which think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race marathon miles down the road it will hit you like brick wall the positive thing to take from paulas olympics it that she will have learned lot from it and so will lot of people including me purely as race paulas victory in the new_york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenyas susan_chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was bit of rarity for me too because genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out kelly and the 4x100m boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that were not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level the only individual mens finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and thats where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the beijing olympics and beyond tell you what really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such surprise was something special to be honest im getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco just wish the whole thing would come to head so we can move on having said that im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek_sprinters kostas_kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it

bangkok film festival battles on organisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this years event despite the ravages of the asian_tsunami disaster the festivities have been scaled down red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund apart from this however the festival has continued as originally planned when the disaster happened we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel said the festivals executive director craig prater the decision was made that we would continue but that the focus would change our premieres became fundraisers the opening night was visibly toned down and of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund he continued but we feel like weve turned page weve acknowledged our position and now its business as usual mr praters sentiments were echoed by christine rush director of the festivals sister event the bangkok film market we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nations recovery from this terrible disaster she said however the nations recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out she added given the conspicuously low audience figures that support may be more symbolic than significant however poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties the eclectic programme contains wide range of titles including such oscar hopefuls as ray_charles biopic_ray and mike_leighs abortion drama vera_drake that said the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers on more positive note the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city problems securing air transport the clash with last sundays golden_globes ceremony in los_angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher alongside such screen stars as michael douglas jeremy irons and jean-claude van damme irons whose film being julia is in competition for the festivals golden kinnaree awards said he had wondered whether he should attend after decembers catastrophe questioned whether should come when such tragedy had happened the british actor said thought it might be in rather bad taste but then spoke to the organisers and was encouraged to let life go on now ive come here im very glad what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west he continued basically was invited here by thailand if they still want you to come you should now in its third year bangkok is relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong_kong tokyo and pusan in south_korea mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal its grown awfully fast in three years maybe too fast he concedes weve had some bumps in the road but thats only because the festival is still baby have no doubt in my mind that in five years this will be the top asian film festival in the world the golden kinnarees will be awarded on friday the festival itself runs until january

blunkett sorry over murder plan david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced prematurely via press release review of murder laws the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of law commission report which branded the current murder law as mess he said the review would look at partial defences to murder including provocation and at mandatory sentences the home office has already said the review will begin next year on wednesday home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in commons debate on wednesday but the announcement never came with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage amid opposition anger mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his gracious apology and the review itself but he argued the minister should have volunteered formal statement instead of having to be dragged to face mps in its report the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be graded to recognise the seriousness of the offence but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility the commission an independent body including two judges senior barrister and sentencing experts had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without far wider review of the law results of consultation exercise showed respondents out of among them judges believed mandatory life sentence for every murder was indefensible and should cease key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence but speaking after the report was published home office minister baroness scotland said murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence where an offender is convicted of murder the court must pass life sentence the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge such as jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife

bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james_bond revival flick of but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the originals massive sense of fun this however is not sequel nor does it relate to the goldeneye film you are the eponymous renegade spy an agent who deserts to the bond worlds extensive ranks of criminal masterminds after being deemed too brutal for mi6 your new commander-in-chief is the portly auric goldfinger last seen in but happily running around bent on world domination with determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turners similarly-titled theme song the game literally gives the player golden eye following an injury which enables degree of x-ray vision rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james_bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by plummeting helicopter the notion is of course to add novel dark edge to game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise this title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like lucky accident the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination admittedly the competition has been tough even in recent weeks with the likes of halo_2 and half life triumphing in virtually every department what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaos as is the trend of late you are made to feel like you are in the midst of really messy and fraught encounter sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos meaning that frustration is often the outcome and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed minute red dot passes for crosshair although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for shooting enemies from distance can be tricky and you will not always know you have picked them off since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations it is perhaps indicative of lack of confidence that the game makers allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights no time is risked with measured build-up by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hat-fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion there is real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such dash but the in-game niggles combined with story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through will make this disappointment for most diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings the game is weak not completely unplayable then again fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras given james bonds healthy pedigree in past games there is every reason to hope that this is just blip commendable idea that just has not worked that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return goldeneye rogue agent is out now

brits debate over urban music joss_stone 17-year-old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is im not really comfortable with the word urban its word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such broad range of black music that its wrong how far are the brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing its so far removed that dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by joss_stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss_stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going on urban as genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are number of core elements that include hip-hop r&b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss_stone is soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss_stone has had amazing success in the us given that shes uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have 17-year-old from devon with voice to die for and bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good think thats whats done it the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base dont think joss was not worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain think thats where you can call it urban thats where this new sub-category or uber-category has come from joss_stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cut-off point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for multi-cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather_than exclusion if joss_stone can be accepted within the urban music community think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award type of music especially street music that originates from city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life she might not be urban but when did r&b become the hip_hop tainted thing it is now r&b stands for rhythm and blues remember that joss_stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music think probably should include hip-hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes good claim she definitely deserved to win prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she is she did deserve it but agree with the comments about urban music its stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip_hop and r&b if say hip_hop here lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange whats in name rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to whilst agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss_stone has won urban to me is what hear being played in parties in the inner cities live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss_stone lets celebrate her victory lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye_west dizzee rascal alicia_keys and outkast we didnt see single black artist on stage collecting an award so what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it shes has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didnt the so-called public vote on this one this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth its lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather_than what it represents demand prize for rural music sucks to the cities- its way better out here we have hay for one thing excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black too how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss_stone is simply singing certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/rnb and hip-hop one which does not also mean something else as we have done with crunk urban is just word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it im in band that has been called urban and despise the label id hate to think belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music as black man think agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented we should stop calling genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss_stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both times better than joss_stone and both of them have won urban music awards and think mobos but why not brits so what if joss_stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up brit seems to be the hardest thing refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people you have said it there is music you like and music you dont like who cares what label you put on it that entire category was mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss_stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british act joss_stone deserved to win an award for her talents but dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie_williams urban is nonsense term music of black origin well doesnt that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesnt make any sense why does music have to be put into genre its music you like it or you dont simple as that play in heavy_metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musically urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed rebrand dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more_than fit the term urban yet as theyre white rock band they wont be described as such joss_stone has fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though theres only two kinds of music good and bad

csi shows give unrealistic view people have unrealistic expectations of forensic_science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows real experts say evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as result of the programmes at time when many have large backlogs science investigators claim lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have distorted view of how forensic evidence is used the issue was discussed at major science conference in washington_dc crime scene investigation csi and its spin-offs csi miami and csi new_york have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic each episode team of forensic investigators goes about solving crime through the ingenious appliance of science and the extensive resources at their disposal the csi effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic_science in response to the tv show said max houck who runs forensic_science graduate course at west virginia university us this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it including the cops and prosecutors and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the american forensics expert said there were roughly backlogged dna samples in us labs yet these constituted just of the total test backlog said dr houck forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the shows influence in dealing with the families of victims what find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case she explained for example on television the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously but when people find out that it can take several months they can find that very difficult dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most peoples perceptions the shows influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom making lawyers jittery prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because for example they wonder why wasnt everything tested well in fact not everything needs to be tested dr houck explained defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as juggernaut this objective method thats always accurate however he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field my university course started with four graduates in were now the largest major on campus with students he said dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic_science at the university level theres more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic_science research

dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence_dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout glittering international career even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of sustained period of success for england dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captains band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the lions tour to south_africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team-mate martin johnson he played massive role in the series victory but after building up seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in first came the last-minute defeat to wales in which dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england grand_slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as lieutenant to new captain johnson as member of new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory journey not without mishaps as succession of grand_slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as key performer once again yet another setback arrived in as serious knee_injury cut short dallaglios involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of englands world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure englands historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnsons retirement dallaglios career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglios second spell as captain losing five of their eight post-world cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of englands most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt_dawson jonny_wilkinson phil_vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglios role as captain but it is as player that england will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more_than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglios massive influence on english rugby

dvd review harry_potter and the prisoner of azkaban this third harry_potter film brought change of director and dramatic visual shake-up that really shines on dvd gone are the warm bright colours found in the two earlier films alfonso cuaron brings in bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous and looks even better here than in the cinema it is all part of the progression of harrys story into darker areas but youll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted as they always are by calamity that only harry ron and hermione can put right it sounds corny but harry is no longer the winsome hero he is moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well emma watson is ever better as hermione and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd but it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras including funny if shallow interviews with all the main cast but what seems like long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch younger viewers will go for the games which include magic you may have missed memory test and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it as we did on the first harry_potter dvd the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring scene short featurette about the making of the films big moments
dvd review robot only one man recognises that robots are threat to humanity but thats fine because it only takes one man to save the day in the thriller robot will smith co-stars alongside more cgi robots than you can count and as thrill-a-minute kind of action film its perfectly adequate youll have forgotten it all tomorrow but youll have fun night with the film and all the extras there is one-disc version that has commentaries and making of but the two-disc adds more unusually for this kind of film the extras dont solely concentrate on the special effects theyre covered but theres also general production diary and post-production feature remember the national lotterys draw machines arthur and guinevere they were more accurate than this glossy hollywood version of the tale but as long as youre not expecting documentary live with it king arthur is fun exciting totally shallow experience and looks excellent clive_owen is the brooding king keira knightly rises above her costume and ray winstone gives it all some grit its at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the making of extra less flashy than david attenborough show and less detailed than simon schama one the bbc series british isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing admit it the fact that this is one of the shows alan titchmarsh left ground force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy but titchmarsh turns out to know his subject and the sight of our present-day landscape being peeled back to reveal the past was fascinating hes now written an accompanying book too
dvd review spider-man its universal rule that film can either be superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good but spider-man breaks that rule in two its not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning few effects look false but tobey maguire kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of detailed look at the film then there are commentaries trailers and blooper reel sometimes quality comes in bulk this set contains no less than john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man now is that christmas present or what give this to someone on december and you wont see them again until early in the new year its not truly complete collection and leans more toward waynes earlier films theres no true grit for instance though there is hellraisers the films look well transferred to dvd though none has extras it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous series became cult favourite thats been long awaited on dvd this set has the first season of buck gil gerard and wilmas erin gray tongue-in-cheek adventures and its all as camp and gaudy as you remember but its also disappointment the us dvd has this and the more po-faced second season and you can import it for just about the same price the bigger omission though is that there are no extras thats particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them

election deal faltered over heath role the tories failed to hold onto power in after liberals demanded sir edward heath quit in return for co-operation documents released after years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime_minister following the dramatic february general_election liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form coalition government but it partly collapsed over the conservative leaders own role prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form labour government the february general_election surprised the nation when it created hung parliament with no party in overall control sir edward had gone to the country for fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis miners strike and the subsequent three-day week labour emerged with the most seats but its mps were short of the number mr wilson needed to form majority sir edward who had received more votes but had fewer mps believed he had the authority to remain at number providing the liberal mps would support his government he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the governments programme or have up to three cabinet members in coalition with the conservatives according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of deal mr thorpe was in high spirits having just led his party to historic jump in support he also argued for grand coalition of all three main parties but sir edward said that was impossible because the labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for conservative-liberal pact hours later sir edwards hopes of deal unravelled as mr thorpes colleagues refused to support him jeremy said he was encountering rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime_minister personally reads telephone memo for mr heath they feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime_minister asked if this was his own view he said no it was not am very close to ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult the following day the stickling points had clearly become two-fold mr thorpes colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edwards resignation mr thorpe told sir edward am sorry this is obviously hell nightmare on stilts for you somehow personally hope that we can work something out four hours later sir edward called the liberal leader back to downing_street in last attempt at deal the minutes of the meeting show how the chance of coalition government quickly evaporated the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime_minister mr thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime_ministers colleagues documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in labour-led coalition but he already knew mr wilson would not form coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form new minority government

end bush denial blair tells eu tony_blair is urging european leaders to wake up from their state of denial over president bushs re-election america has spoken the rest of the world should listen the prime_minister said in an interview with the times newspaper published on friday mr blair is at summit in brussels where iraq and european justice and immigration plans are on the agenda french president jacques_chirac reacted to his warning by saying europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity mr blair has probably been closer to president bush than any other european leader he said some people were in sort of state of denial about the us election result but predicted more receptive mood would emerge soon america needed to listen to the world too he said the fact is that president bush is there for four years he is there because the american people have chosen him he argued he also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together britain was uniquely placed to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the us he suggested he admitted he had gone to bed at 2230gmt well before the american polls closed thinking mr kerry might have won he woke up at 0530gmt to discover mr bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result his words about president bush met cool reception from jacques_chirac the french president told reporters europe today has more_than ever the need the necessity to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity that is the goal of the constitution in world that is more multi-polar than ever mr chirac will miss an address to the summit from iraqi interim leader iyad allawi who this week criticised nations which took spectator role to iraqs reconstruction mr chirac denied there was any snub he is going to memorial service for the united arab emirates late leader and says he would be happy to meet mr allawi he also signed communiqu&#233 stressing the eus commitment to securing stable and unified iraq the eu also confirmed new $21m aid package the communiqu&#233 congratulated president bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations the summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline european asylum and immigration decisions mr blair recently said the uk would only participate in eu-wide measures where it was in uk interests but the tories say he is surrendering key veto the meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in lisbon in to make europe more competitive
european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well think we could be heading to the european championships with half dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the 60m_hurdles running sub-eight seconds twice in week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up medal but what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in head-to-head race will give sarah confidence in the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the mens 60m_hurdles is so strong think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of 17.30m which puts him at the top of the world rankings had chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is good performance he is such huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board thought kelly_sotherton had great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and 60m_hurdles and you cant ask for more_than that kelly will be up against carolina_kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of medal on the basis of what weve seen so far she has complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasnt all good news in sheffield thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways jason_gardener may have won but he wasnt at his best chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him hes there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got big scalp out there in the womens race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with chest infection if she had made the final think jeanette would have gone bit quicker janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following two-year drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by long way and that shouldnt be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition think that would help her couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the 400m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them

franz man seeks government help franz_ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather_than to go to bed with them he said kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotlands role in making 21st_century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent self-sufficient he said but so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to particular party however dont know if having tea with politicians is always good idea kapranos and his glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks brit awards including best group and best album their self-titled debut album won last years mercury music prize and spawned three top singles he told the 300-strong audience at the universitys reid hall that musicians should listen to wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say like this because listen to nirvana and korn am troubled individual im riddled with angst because listen to chopin and debussy listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and like to party listen to wagner because like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm he concluded we define ourselves as nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by long way than their upcoming brits performance dont really care about the brits he said its going to be great to go down but have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels rather_than expecting the government i.e the taxpayer to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in some of britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government funds if they can fund football why not fund music areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash the government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that as scot living in england appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being success so can see no problem with it franz_ferdinand travis and snow_patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies know that if was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping would want to finance myself until was in position to pursue corporate sponsorship yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the masses there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use as long as the government was funding real talent it would be great move would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about only if the proposals make financial sense franz_ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales if theyd had government grant to get started theyd have more_than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more_than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre musician the government shouldnt fund music it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out great deal yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is great deal of money generated through pop music perhaps tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it tax on music pollution if you like though really like franz_ferdinand have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations like save the music in the us

gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last years sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in more bellicose mood than last time this sequel gives the franchise grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence as before you control the super-athletic prince from third-person perspective the time-travelling plot hinges on the dahaka an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beasts creation studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be ever since the series then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect combining them at speed is the best fun although getting handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill until you reach that point it is haphazard business all too often you will perform stunning triple somersault pirouette off wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over cliff to your doom that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before the games developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off warrior within is very slick package the games intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences it is on par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anti-climax that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game the music is probably the worst aspect merit-free heavy_metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for

how the academy awards flourished the 77th annual academy awards are taking place on february with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year but from humble beginnings how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in at comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel just over the road from their modern day home just guests attended with ticket prices at the first film to win was wings which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award for the first years or so the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm but in the winners were published in the los_angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results as result the sealed envelope system was introduced leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today when and where the tradition of holding the awards at banquet continued until but with increasing interest came growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as dinner the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous graumans chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium they are now held at the kodak_theatre which opened in just across the road from its original home and holds people until they were held on thursday then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february the first televised ceremony was in with bob hope as the mc who was oscar there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburns first best actress win in the academy officially adopted the nickname in the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons since its inception oscars have been handed out in support of the war effort the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii after the war winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in were recovered nine days later winners were unaffected as new batch was rushed out who sits in judgement the academy was set up in as non-profit organisation with members from different film disciplines douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards there are now members of the academy with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers some of the criteria for admittance includes film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy receipt of an academy award nomination achievement of unique distinction earning of special merit or making an outstanding contribution to film the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics among the overlooked films were hobsons choice dirty harry the steps the searchers and king kong actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer humphrey bogart in casablanca gene kelly in singing in the rain and henry fonda in angry men alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an

ii or the vietnam war documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq_war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions los_angeles floods in saw it put back week the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in as mark of respect and there was 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan controversies and other gaffes three people have refused

at the time marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in in protest as hollywoods apparent discrimination against native american people he sent along woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked flashing peace sign as well

recently quit the uk independence party,said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told london news conference that veritas latin for truth would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger_knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk mr kilroy-silk promised firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general_election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks and he announced the party would be holding leadership election on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general_election that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoons ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukips two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukips chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be parody of the party the men have left mr kilroy-silk announced his decision to quit ukip at public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be member of ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last junes european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people shall not he said will be standing at the next general_election shall be leading vigorous campaign for the causes believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would deliver better as the leader of eurosceptic party spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has moral obligation if not legal one to stand down its leader roger_knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice_knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show united front and give the uk public serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone now ukip at least has chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy-silk could have lot to offer instead we have split party and damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk it is great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting ukip has wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force by-elections to stand on their own platform rather_than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that party committed to plain speaking should have latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy here lets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that

assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has moral obligation if not legal one to stand down its leader roger_knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice_knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead veritas its the bnp in an expensive suit its all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming that veritas is party that doesnt believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two-horse race trend in my opinion this is just publicity stunt which has just been used as smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many it really is time that the uk government ceased to be paper tiger on this issue in addition as an ashfield constituent would be more_than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done lets hope kilroy-silk ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as country want to go not running away from it all mouth and trousers clown trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into third term whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from right-wing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more_than one issue england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we cant rely on the usa forever at last an impetus for increasing the likely turn out for the election the electorate is disillusioned with british politics kilroy has one agenda the uk and ill be voting for him both ukip and rk-s are representatives of small-mindedness and lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these peoples bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiff many people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls ive always thought that kilroy-silk was self-publicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion brilliant about time this country had plausible party having seen the recent bbc documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of number of senior ukip figures can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action fantastic news pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s and the extreme anti-europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections robert kilroy-silks ego and vanity are his own and his supporters worst enemy as euro-enthusiast could not be more delighted by kilroy-silks behaviour he took party that was just building up head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting coup-detat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better as far as am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose wed have ballot_papers mile long youve got to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief whilst not being great fan of kilroy do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him am also leaving ukip believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means the eus comments last week about michael_howards plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is matter for the eu and not individual member_states the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used latin name for his new party rather_than good old british name is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompous think mr kilroy-silk has got very good point british politics has become too pc and as result has no straight talking honest strong politicians they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power as result feel our democracy is being abused and want it stopped if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote honestly who really cares man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no idea as one of kilroy-silks east_midlands constituents hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukips democratic nature kilroy is an able communicator and capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not he tried to make it work but they didnt seem to want to grow up he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media this new party seems logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man say oh please this is an amusing irrelevance there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument they will play key part in winning the country round to the idea of reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim this have suspicion that he talks for larger part of the electorate that his critics would like shall be voting for him the electorate of the east_midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukips party list he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament wouldnt write off kilroy-silk while hes clown and one man band at the moment hes populist and thats always dangerous.the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success good luck to kilroy though think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting somewhat uphill battle the man once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my countrys knight in shining armour he expresses views which are now more_than common amongst society today but people are almost too scared to express them kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me whats more look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation without hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever great stuff the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only english-speaking country fully committed to europe oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants our economy needs them this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show united front and give the uk public serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone now ukip at least has chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy-silk could have lot to offer instead we have split party and damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk it is great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting ukip has wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force by-elections to stand on their own platform rather_than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that party committed to plain speaking should have latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party its all flash and no real policy here lets hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that

kinnock to urge reform in lords neil kinnock has said his acceptance of seat in the house_of_lords will allow him to help achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform on the bbcs_breakfast with frost it was put to mr kinnock that he had once referred to lords members as brigands muggers bribers and gangsters but the outgoing european commissioner said his comments made some years ago needed to be put in context he said advocates for reform needed to be inside the lords to vote for it it was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the lords and people there willing to vote for it mr kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the british council history demonstrates that its immensely useful for the british council to have its chairman in the house_of_lords and that was conclusive factor mr kinnock said he thought about the decision for quite long time because he had long had reservations about the lords but he added the process of reform has developed substantially but not sufficiently and consequently did take all these factors into consideration because its not decision to be made glibly the former labour leader said he would probably take the title of lord kinnock of bedwellty his first constituency for which he was selected in

labours election love-in peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days if press reports are to be believed alan_milburn and gordon_brown have been at each others throats over the contents of labours next election manifesto but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning as they joined john prescott to unveil labours latest poster campaign the event at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames was carefully choreographed show of unity and the surest sign yet that we are heading for general_election in the next few months it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions labours speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker and the mgs then vw camper van trundled into view decked out in that most mind-bending of psychedelic messages lowest mortgage rate for years as the side-door slid open it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together scooby doo-style but sadly it wasnt the cabinet who had raided the dressing-up box just six rather ill-at-ease looking labour students two were dressed as regency dandies to unveil poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for years another pair of students were in beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest_rates since the 1960s the remaining two were dressed in vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the lowest unemployment since the seventies the politicians led out by john prescott were soberly-suited as always the event may have been designed to highlight labours economic success under mr brown but there was little doubt who was in charge the chancellor walked side-by-side with mr milburn pointedly exchanging chit chat as they approached the microphone but it was mr milburn who took centre stage speaking of the positive campaign the party hoped to stage in the coming weeks and months the mobile poster vans would let people know britain is working again mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labours shared purpose and united dedication it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellors record and in final flourish to produce his famous pledge card from claiming labour has met all of its promises the event was carefully stage-managed to underline cabinet unity and more specifically to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn but keen students of body language will have had field day there was much forced smiling for the cameras but only mr prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself mr milburn made point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully but it was the former health secretarys final gesture placing an arm on mr browns back as they walked away from the microphones which was perhaps the most telling thanks for dropping by gordon he might have been saying

lasting influence of legend charles ray_charles who has won string of posthumous grammy awards belonged to pioneering generation of artists that had huge influence on the course of rock and pop music his sound encompassed so many styles blues gospel jazz rock n_roll even country and had real impact on the nascent uk beat and r&b scenes compared in stature to elvis_presley by some commentators charles songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as joe cocker steve winwood eric burdon and van morrison his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones with whom he recently recorded duet if james brown was the godfather of soul then ray_charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers along with sam cooke he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the devils music of r&b to pave the way for new generation of soul artists without charles it is hard to imagine the tear-stained atlantic r&b sound of aretha franklin otis redding or wilson pickett he was also talented jazz composer arranger and band leader playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david fathead newman unfortunately he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era that of heroin addiction which led to him being arrested in his string of 1950s atlantic r&b successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock n_roll greats including ive got woman roy orbison elvis_presley and hallelujah love her so eddie cochran after the exuberance of his signature song whatd say charles turned towards more pop-oriented style recording hoagy carmichaels sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind and the upbeat hit the road jack he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again more_than years after its release his abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as classic his version of don gibsons cant stop loving you topped the pop and r&b charts in the us in he made rare foray into protest songs with his album message from the people on it he took stand on poverty and civil rights echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie_wonder james brown curtis mayfield and marvin gaye more_than years later he would embrace contemporary production with his album my world which featured hip-hop beats although charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged in june was one from his friend the producer quincy jones who described him as brother in every sense of the word there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray_charles did he said former manfred mann singer paul jones who sang on 1960s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la said charles was one of his heroes im quite sure my own writing was influenced by him he told bbc_news online would put money on the proposition that ray_charles will have an influence on music forever
learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson one of the nice things about being writer is that rarely have to go to an office to work can sit in caf&#233 or library with or without wi-fi connection and research and write articles if am passing through kings cross station on my way to meeting then can log on from the platform and can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne childrens writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network but just over week ago arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with new cable modem this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial-up connection on her daughters laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting slower and flakier net connection as result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial-up she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively but the impact spread into her personal life too she did not take her children to the cinema during half-term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas she planned trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website and she did not know where to go fossil-hunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found book on fossils but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things she may be unusual but do not think anne is alone according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april and numbers are climbing fast there will certainly be five million by the end of the year dial-up users are switching to broadband my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason it is part of the process of adaptation and it is vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world in south_korea japan and hong_kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits second rather_than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with but speed is only small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient it may not be the brave new world of streaming full-screen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now and it is certainly better than slow access or no access just ask anne bill thompson is regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes down and then has to save break point after tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set roddicks serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set three times nadal forces break point and three times the world number two hangs in and roddicks grit pays off as he manages to hold roddick still looks bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with break point which nadal saves with good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold there is disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with service winner the game passes the two-hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set now roddick has to

gives nadal three break points the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with double fault and the rubber is level nadal edges towards taking the second set with comfortable hold two good serves put roddick up but he then makes couple of errors to find himself down he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold roddicks level has dropped while nadal is on hot streak the

saves break point with superb stop volley before going on to hold nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second roddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then nadal loops crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points but roddick saves them and then earns one himself nadal comes up with down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddicks next set point nadals nerve is tested as he tries to force tiebreak both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points the point of the match so far involves roddicks slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally on the very next point nadal blasts forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game nadal outplays roddick to reach but the american fights back to before nadals powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game the crowd are getting very involved cheering between roddicks first and second serves but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds powerful ace down the middle gives nadal simple love service game the first time he has held serve so far in the match if roddick didnt know before he knows now that he is in real contest another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows four of the first five games have seen break of serve despite the disappointment of losing his serve roddick is not phased and storms into lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm close line-call nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with sharp volley at the net roddicks advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve nadal pumps his fist in celebration the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadals serve from the start nadals drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break after moyas win in the opening rubber raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadals

oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer less contentious cinema if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moores bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit and mel_gibsons the passion_of_the_christ both films polarised opinion but had critics talking and the public turning up to see them fahrenheit breaking us box_office records for documentary and the passion_of_the_christ making more_than us$370m 196m in the us alone but this years academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies with the passion_of_the_christ film accused of being anti-semitic receiving nominations only in the minor categories of cinematography makeup and musical score fahrenheit has also been overlooked despite winning the palme dor at the cannes international film festival in moores caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors decision to enter it in the best picture category rather_than best documentary says tim dams the news editor of trade magazine screen international but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moores film does not sit well with the academy if you look at past oscar winners and nominees the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative epic-style pictures fahrenheit didnt really fit in to that category they tend to go for films like titanic gladiator and the lord_of_the_rings films with scale that often arent too contentious he said while he said the oscar voting panel were not snubbing moores film he thought it was unlikely documentary could ever seriously compete in best film category think its more misjudgement by the people putting it out rather_than deliberate snub he said the problem with mel_gibsons film he believed was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating film with dialogue in aramaic an ancient middle eastern language hollywood doesnt tend to like foreign-language films no-ones ever tried doing film in dead language he said but aside from these two films some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations the german film the downfall biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker has been recognised in the best foreign film category the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as fallible but human man rather_than semi-mythical historical monster but mr dams said its not an inflammatory film it has done very well in germany and its film that portrays hitler as human rather_than some kind of devil or monster another contentious film mr dams said has gained nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its super size portions in the us after he went on month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals and filmed his progress the film has been hit around the world mr dams said its political film but its quite fun and punky and well-paced morgan spurlock is really likeable guy its very accessible film and it doesnt beat you over the head with its views while in fahrenheit there are moments of comedy think the way that super size me is put together the fact its very likeable film means its won through on charm dams pick at this years oscars the aviator martin_scorseses biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes tinseltown it seems likes nothing more_than picture about one of its own

profile gordon_brown the ultimate prize of downing_street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver record-breaking ninth budget gordon_brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times he reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and days between and how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general_election but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors or politicians before him gordon_brown was born in glasgow on february the son of church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy at he was canvassing for labour and by his 20s he was leading political activist in scotland he achieved first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete phd his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making name for himself in the scottish labour party his first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael_ancram but in he took dunfermline east new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal towns entering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony_blair within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury he became shadow chancellor under john smiths leadership in after the death of leader john smith in he stood aside agreeing to give tony_blair clear run at the leadership during now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington the other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend mr blairs supporters say such deal never existed and endless newspaper columns and even television film have been devoted to the alleged deal but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in mr brown continued his devotion to politics during the election campaign he is said to have worked an average of hours day six days week after running on treadmill for an hour each morning this dedication to his career was underlined by comment by mr browns former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of ex-king michael of romania who said relationship with him was politics politics politics if that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary days after being born seven weeks prematurely year later in october the couple had son john an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing_street neighbour over the succession mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime_minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute after recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brown/blair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general_election after fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan_milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown using the budget as springboard is to revitalise labours campaign amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown including mr milburn but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can and mr blairs decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for even if the prime_ministers intention to serve full third term if elected took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters

radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs paula_radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals the marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the suspicions and innuendoes which greet any fast time doping in sport is criminal offence and should be treated as such the 30-year-old told the sunday times it not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters sponsors and the general public radcliffes comments come at time when several american sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use being caught in possession of performance-enhancing drugs should carry penalty she added the current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes this means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on level playing field if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route often when an athlete puts in good performance they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise having been on the receiving end of accusations like this can testify as to how much this hurts
radcliffe proves doubters wrong this wont go down as one of the greatest marathons of paulas career but as test of character it was the toughest race shes ever taken part in win in the new_york marathon doesnt make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year if paulas last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism she can now draw line under this year and make plans about her future even if shed lost this race there would have been lot of positives to take out of it she knows she can dig deep if she needs to it was strong field with number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning and although two hours minutes wasnt one of paulas best times it wasnt far off the record on difficult course was speaking to paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing no-win situation she thought that if she won people would say why couldnt she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over and lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in athens but that was never on the cards she might have been beaten but she would have kept running the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions werent at play here the only question was what position she could finish in most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paulas mind if she wasnt confident she wouldnt have run after all if youre the best in the world at an event youll always have expectations of winning now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year have well-earned rest over christmas and go into next year with lot of optimism
radcliffe tackles marathon tasks paula_radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new_york city marathon on sunday back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens_olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race the ability to run gruelling miles relies largely upon an athletes belief that they can do it every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer potential crisis of confidence there is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you richards told bbc sport paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is very effective strategy for distance running if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new_york win or lose if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled has-been and her profile will suffer and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians she must not get caught up in someone_elses agenda radcliffes best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new_york she just thought well they cant think any worse of me now yelling told bbc sport shes just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it radcliffe described her decision to enter the new_york marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have tick-list of personal goals her aims could be as simple as completing race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption you cant change history warned richards only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just days after the athens marathon its suggested after major marathon you take full month off and start building up again said yelling herself marathon runner but that is only for long-term health and fitness when you finish marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly so physically it is possible for paula richards also points out conditions in new_york will be more conducive to strong physical display from radcliffe the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens he said and that just isnt going to be there in new_york thats been taken out of the equation radcliffe concedes she will probably learn lot from her bad experiences in athens in time and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in new_york how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not argues richards one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities and yelling says think this will probably make paula think it will drive her on and shell come out of it better athlete

record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and would just love her to put us out of our misery and have go at it rather_than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and would like to see her have go at 5m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside thought it was very encouraging evenings work for kelly_holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three 800m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is bit of benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor_championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand think jason_gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens 60m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners jason has lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark_lewis-francis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look bit silly my view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but havent seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests frances ronald pognon who has run seconds will be under threat at the europeans from british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the 60m_hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the womens national 400m race in new personal best of seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have very strong 4x400m squad going to the european championships scotlands lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have real prospect of medal from an international perspective thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3,000m but dont think the pace-making was great canadian heather hennigar set fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar real run for her money she had go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting bit more from bernard lagat in the mens 1500m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and felt uncomfortable in the commentary box think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly
redfords vision of sundance despite sporting corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus pair of dark glasses robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star-struck crowds at sundance its rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city utah back in the 1980s now in its twenty-first year sundance continues to grow some people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind its an opportunity to meet and make deals redford wanted sundance to be platform for independent film-makers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundances limelight but redford is not worried the more the merrier he says the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them once independent film had place where the work could be seen suddenly the merchants came with them the celebrities came then the paparazzi and suddenly it began to take on whole new tone explains redford people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film he adds international film-makers have always been celebrated here but is the first year dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect particularly how the us is perceived internationally he has never hidden the fact that he is democrat but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration its the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration he says think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view thats very unhealthy and very dangerous if we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences sundance isnt just one big screening there are discussion panels and q&a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like americas culture wars and the iraq_war while redford wishes the festival to be forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic educated middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum anti-war and socially liberal but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach wider audience when you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian and its about good films and good story-telling be it african america asian women gay lesbian sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say its just film by so-and so

magic_roundabout which will be released as sprung in the us replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s tv show with polished computer-generated animation in similar fashion the thunderbirds used

youth back get your hands off the clangers is nothing sacred make movie version of the banana splits what about keanu reeves and richard_gere in remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie_williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldnt be better than the original series could it its always nice to see these old toons re-released but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song think ive been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memories think remakes are good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create wider audience and possibly entice new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally id like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and m.a.s.k get full hollywood remakes leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond_memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not patch on the puppet series grew up with and the magic_roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson love to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least rating part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic_roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place have fond_memories of bod not least of which because look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into film its got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have girlfriend or two its all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for new audience but for me lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic_roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are film-makers running out of original ideas all can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when was child there was new captain pugwash cartoon made couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation this time computer created flat-cell like animation failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in sampling world the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather_than being daring and trying something new it got to be mr.benn the story line about man who changes in fancy dress shop steps into door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing if they got decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny_depp playing role similar to the pirates_of_the_caribbean character muffin the mule perhaps after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know why cant the british film industry try making gerry andersons ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people in todays media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes djs are sampling or re-working 70s and 80s music even computer games from years ago are getting modern re-workings personally think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone mary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of vicky pollard character as she lives in high rise council block yeah but no but wasnt even there id like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner it demonstrates profound lack of imagination in todays film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern childrens book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead would have loved to see dungeons dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didnt come up to scratch the only one that isnt to be remade as yet is thundercats which id like to see im an expat living in norway and recently went through period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite childrens programs for my daughters my dearest wish however is to see feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavian rainbow believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and will not be surprised if the magic_roundabout does not do well at the box_office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because its original witty and modern the magic_roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod.....oh the list could go on and on if transformers movie is indeed on the cards then ill be the first one on amazon buying copy eagerly waiting at the front door with frothy mouth and nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price dont care till then ill have to make do with the citreon c4 advert id luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb childrens programme could morph hold his own in big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm could go on and on danger mouse at im showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best childrens programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach oliver postgates wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on whole new level with more life-like fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall one puppet show that personally would love to see made into live action movie is joe it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joes car of course gerry andersons supermarionation is rich seam of material worthy of big-screen big-budget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as childrent movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves its only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isnt it id hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation love that done in shed clunkiness and you couldnt recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in look around you mock-authentic style might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other peoples ideas because it guarantees to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term the fact that they will be forgotten in months time is irrelevant e.g starsky hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it pray they never do remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only and dont remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and its classic the fact its so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to todays stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though its so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be real shame if they did remake it

watch published at the start of last year scissor sisters franz_ferdinand keane joss_stone and mcfly were all in the sound of top the other five brits winners were already established before sound of was compiled the ceremony will be televised on itv1 on thursday im speechless best song of the last years yeah right very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out like every track robbie has released as single its blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before give us break best song in years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but really listened to angels on radio this morning when was driving into work had not heard it for while love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfection as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more_than dozen songs in the last years that deserve this award more its not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last years what about the specials ghost town the buzzcocks ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy_division love will tear us apart angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish angels is awful piece of sentimental claptrap its musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated bit like mr williams himself this result isnt very surprising though the brits has long history of celebrating rubbish music best of the last years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it bit of hollow award really not much competition in the last years after all its alright for pop song but the best song of the last years there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last years....its travesty rubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list am regular listener to radio but dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while am biassed in that thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness think that the best song of the last years should not include songs less than years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show youve got to be kidding angels is great song but not the best song of the last years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits think angels is great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but dont think its the best song from the past years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song isnt that good im happy for robbie himself though best song in the last years what joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix still at least it wasnt will young oh its all just bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even non-fans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with agree about angels never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbie think that although robbie_williams is good performer that angels isnt really that good song it certainly isnt anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy_division or wuthering heights by kate bush angels is fantastic song all credit to robbie_williams and guy chambers its song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example they werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think yes angels is the best song since the past years because it touches the soul as it carries lot of meaning ive always disliked angels intensely believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting its orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing it is merely an irritating distraction wasp that refuses to go away on summers afternoon picnic what dreadful result if you voted for it you should feel ashamed of yourself you probably only know dozen songs or so dont you so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisss angels best song you are kidding right last five years might be willing to accept but no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of century no surprise about robbie_williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps mean will young come on what load of crap best song in the last years dont think so what about all the real artists out there over the last years the list is endless but robbie_williams doesnt even come close what joke that song has become such bane to me that have developed pavlovian response to the word angels where thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off why half-baked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop_idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last years think not didnt realize radio had so many listeners under the age of people have such short memories great song yes but the best of the last years not chance think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here the great british public at work again its mediocre sentimental and safe song granted its not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone_roses first album nope no because im not female and im not ok like robbie and angels is decent song but it is no way the best song of the past years the shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is joke predictable and laughable the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last years am huge robbie fan and love that song but think there are lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list have radio listeners even heard of joy_division band who through two albums have had bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last years than robbie_williams ever will no doubt about it theres not song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with far larger audience than any other song it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song sincerely do not believe that in years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie_williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today yes think its brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was deserved winner am astounded that such second-rate record has beaten such line up of amazing songs its terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music the best song of the past years really come on this is surely joke no think need long lie down it just goes to show that the british public do not have clue about good quality music when they pick robbie_williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy_division suppose its confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull &lt no offence robbie but pleeease there must be thousand better songs than formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and further nail in the coffin think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesnt deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it if this is the best song of the last years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record sad day for music its not the type of music normally like but even as diehard rock fan recognise that it is good song and appelas to most people thats why it has been voted best song of the last years its good all-rounder just like robbie best song in years since im confused angels isnt bad song its nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything its regressive bland even suppose its just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become granted angels is good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition the queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for him best song of the last years what ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasnt bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful angels is without doubt great song but really dont think it deserves the title of best song in years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song dont get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners it would have been travesty had angels not won without angels robbie_williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past years im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular ive nothing against robbie actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year the brits has proved to be nothing more_than bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters think this is superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near u2s new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit no surprise really its voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music personally find angels by robbie_williams to be one of the most irritating songs have ever heard it absolutely deserved to win it is song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come its an absolute joke however most of the original were very poor choices as well all in all pretty pointless exercise the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy_division or queen suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of will young though although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent although angels is good song think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if thats all it means

u2s desire to be number one u2 who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive if not always groundbreaking but such success is down to more_than music they have to be compelling performers charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground they also have to want it they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it the beatles had it the rolling_stones still have it rem hold onto it and queen were it in catsuit and u2 have it in spades and keep churning it out their new album how to dismantle_an_atomic bomb comes years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all-time rock a-list they may have lost some of the edginess and raw youthful force that propelled them to the top but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums vertigo the first single from the new album went straight into the uk singles_chart at number one knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top hit the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better to make records the whole world will listen to bono recently said drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments were very competitive we want to be on the radio have big singles we dont want to be thought of as veteran band the band have done everything in their considerable powers to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world according to magazine editor paul rees this makes them hugely determined and formidable he added they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up as such theyve constantly re-invented and challenged themselves they are perhaps alone as the only rock band that has got better with age the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised mr rees said they do everything in the right way the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on high school notice board attracting fellow pupils paul hewson bono vocals adam clayton bass david evans the edge guitar and his brother dick dick evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u2 by they had won talent contest and got noticed by manager paul mcguinness they were brilliant but very coarse mcguinness recently said in way they were doing exactly what they do now only badly they struggled to attract record company attention later being described as pretty damn average and strange and eerie by scouts who saw them live they released two ireland-only singles which topped the national charts in and leading to deal with island and their debut album boy the stadium-filling anthemic sound was u2s aim from the start and their third album war saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic going to number one in the uk and in the us songs like sunday bloody sunday and new years day brought success and an image as political and spiritual band which bono rejected as cliche his stage performances which included flag-waving speaker-climbing and drum-throwing earned him reputation as an electric performer and their appearance at 1985s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom in the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name still havent found what im looking for and with or without you those songs took the bands epic atmospheric sound to simple powerful and popular pinnacle the end of the decade marked crucial point for the band they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music plus wildly extravagant stage shows while still trying to retain their mass appeal the achtung baby album in was followed by zooropa pop and their corresponding stadium tours which featured giant olives flying cars live phone calls to the white house and bonos transformation into alter-egos the fly and macphisto he was also building parallel reputation not always to the pleasure of his bandmates as campaigner on issues from global debt to aids before the release of how to dismantle_an_atomic bomb they had sold million albums around the world but they still want more

uk needs true immigration data former home office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor uk immigration barbara roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government she said this would counter so-called independent groups like migration watch which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent migration watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures sir andrew green chairman of the organisation says there is no need for an independent body because office of national statistics data are accurate he says he opposes large-scale immigration both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture he said for example over the next years one household in three will be due to immigration we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france ms roche labour mp for hornsey and wood green believes legal migration is something we should welcome she said her proposals mean we wouldnt have so-called independent experts like migration watch who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view she went on what would like to see is there being body which actually looked at the figures published them and was independent of government think that would go long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate

ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silks veritas party damian hockney now veritas deputy leader and peter hulme-cross were elected in on the list system the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives not as individuals mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on list who quit their party should keep their seats ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in letter she said the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on list their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate he accused the party of signing up to deal with the tories in europe rather_than sticking to an independent stance but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman who said mr hockneys accusations are like his sense of political morals empty veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader
ukip mep attacked german empire uk independence party mep suggested germany saw the eu as an empire and was cheaper than using tanks new documentary has revealed mike nattrass ukips deputy leader made the comments to an audience at meeting during last septembers hartlepool by-election campaign but challenged on the remark he denied accusing germany of using the eu as cover for 4th german reich he says he was not german-bashing but saying peace was the eus founding aim the meeting was shown in bbc film on ex-ukip mep robert kilroy-silk the former chat show host quit the party earlier this month calling it joke the documentary showed mr nattrass apparently talking about the eu telling the meeting the germans are the big losers here but they dont care because to them the project is worthwhile its like an empire for them spreading in all directions away from germany into hungary into what they call the sudetenland czechoslovakia places like that so its cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in on tuesday he told the bbc_news website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with meps of different nationalities in the european parliament he argued that peace was the only reason for having the outdated eu as there was no economic justification pointing to germanys trade interests as country in the centre of europe mr nattrass said the fact is that the eu benefits germany but it does not benefit britain im not at all german-bashing its the truth ukip spokesman said mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them the documentary showed some of the tensions between mr kilroy-silk and his fellow meps after ukip took third place in last years european elections he denied wanting to be leader until october when he told bbc ones_breakfast with frost programme he aspired to the job asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions mr kilroy-silk said there was one thing said that shouldnt have said at the time was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do should have told the truth the film also included footage of row between mr kilroy-silk mep nigel farage and party leader roger_knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the ukip whip in the european parliament mr kilroy-silk told them he had not left the ukip group move he announced shortly after the meeting he told mr farage dont tell lies nigel now youve told too many most of the trouble had been caused by you ukip officials claim it was in fact mr kilroy-silk not mr farage who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of meps later in unguarded off-air comments in television studio mr kilroy-silk was heard saying he was irritated by defending some of these right-wing fascist nutters mr kilroy-silk separately said he had argued against ukip working with such groups which believed homosexuality was sin ukip spokesman said there were more_than meps in the same group in the european parliament they were from broad spectrum some right-wing some left-wing but with shared belief in the unfeasibility of the eu as it is now he did not defend other groups religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views just as mr kilroy-silk had right to criticise arab states london ukip mep gerard batten said robert has made variety of comments about ukip and its meps there are of course two sides to every story what robert does not say is that he was offered several positions which would have given him effective control of the party but not the title of leader mr kilroy-silk is to launch his own parry veritas in westminster on wednesday
ukip outspent labour on eu poll the uk independence party outspent both labour and the liberal_democrats in the european elections new figures show ukip which campaigned on slogan of say no to europe spent 2.36m on the campaign second only to the conservatives 3.13m the campaign took ukip into third place with an extra meps labours campaign cost 1.7m the lib dems 1.19m and the greens according to figures revealed by the electoral_commission on wednesday much of the ukip funding came from yorkshire millionaire sir paul sykes who helped bankroll the partys billboard campaign critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes but ukip spokesman said labour and the conservatives had spent 10m between them on the last general_election with the advantages of public money the others have the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space he added
ukips secret weapon by any measure new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else winner this is the man who some pundits believe was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clintons sensational comeback victory but morris is no ideologue he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay now he is back in london as the uk independence partys not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped you guessed it opposition candidate viktor_yushchenko if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances that he enjoys the game more_than the politics so why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes is not likely to pull off sensational victory in the looming general_election on this subject morris appears almost evangelical was on cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so was ukip leader roger_knapman had just written piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism great soundbite but surprise coming from new yorker post september it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who dont believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined thats international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary_fund the world bank and primarily the european union so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable the tory party is schizophrenic about europe but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they cant possibly re-negotiate anything as michael_howard is pledged to do its like walking into liquor store with gun to rob it and saying before can proceed with the robbery want to make clear am not going to shoot anybody possibly very american analogy but another great soundbite the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it so is ukips job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared no the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories spine on the issue by having large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move but its not just to shift the tories think ukip had huge amount to do with tony_blairs decision to hold referendum on the european constitution and think it had huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro and while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites robert kilroy silk is not team player it is good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one so what is the big plan for the general_election how will he achieve the breakthrough look we are not going to be forming the next government he said neither does ukip have to fight every seat as with the us presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by small number of swing seats just as he believes it will in britain so with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with significant group in the commons he also believes it is possible the internet could have big part in the poll the internet was decisive factor in the presidential election through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries people just did it anything can happen in the next general_election there is an inherent instability at the moment labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice that might he suggests lead to hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power it is huge task surely but there is undoubtedly sense that the next general_election may indeed produce some surprises even while most still believe it is labours for the taking ukips performance in last years european elections was just such shocker and showed that mr morris may have point about the new consensus and after all he has reputation to sustain

us afflicted with awards fatigue the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema-goers and the tv-viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies according to some la film critics bob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other he came up with colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates celebrity love-in this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic as chris rock accurately said theyre about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said the recent grammy music awards proved to be ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner unsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue but entertainment weeklys dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when blockbuster such as titanic or lord_of_the_rings was nominated the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said quick scan of the los_angeles times and los_angeles daily news bears this out speculation about who will win seems to have ground to halt on thursday the times simply printed picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak_theatre to protect the red_carpet from rain variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie_foxx dead cert to win screen internationals us editor mike goodridge thinks 2004s films have simply not grabbed the publics imagination film-makers havent produced films that people adore this year he said they adored saving private ryan for example people loved it and it made ton of money 2004s films could be reaction to there was realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all audiences dont necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar_baby aviator and finding_neverland which end with casualty as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopeful mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added im all for lower ratings though there are far more important things going on than the oscars mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rocks humour could prompt americas conservative states to switch off so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would win clint_eastwoods million dollar_baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin_scorseses aviator and million dollar_baby mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike_leighs abortion drama vera_drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said after all its still one of the biggest tv events of the year

what now for british tennis tim henmans decision to quit davis_cup tennis has left the british team with gargantuan void to fill the world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament he has from his rubbers and great britains last davis_cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as worse could follow according to former british team member chris bailey bailey told bbc sport after tims announcement doubt greg_rusedski will be that far behind him but without their top two where does that leave british ambitions in the sports premier team event captain jeremy bates has singled out alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as potential replacements the yugoslavian-born bogdanovic though is places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties winning one and losing the other murray on the other hand is 407th in the current atp entry list and yet to make his cup debut but bailey does see some hope for the future he said now weve dropped down to the euro-africa zone the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore britains next opponents israel are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the march match against likely trio of bogdanovic murray and the 187th-ranked arvind parmar bailey said it will be tough for gb to move up but there comes time when our young players have to step up this was always going to be inevitable with tim and gregs growing years im confident about the future wouldnt lay money on us getting back into the world group next year but id imagine in five years time well be competing for the major honours of those lining up to replace henman the 17-year-old murray with four futures titles under his belt last year looks the best long-term bet murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over tims mantle said bailey he has an enormous amount of self-confidence judging by what hes said in the past bogdanovic three years murrays senior has had more troubled time under britains davis_cup umbrella while murray has been marked out as britains golden boy bogdanovic was warned by the lawn tennis association for lack of drive at the end of and bailey said despite that alex is clearly talented as well while arvind is another contender theyre among the guys who have experienced the intensity of davis_cup tennis whether as players or on the sidelines the lta has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that now theyll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup and im confident that will springboard team gb to greater success
what now for kelly_holmes last april kelly_holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the dont know box holmes has now pulled out of this weekends european indoor_championships where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m because of hamstring_injury but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well its lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram you have to have real strong desire to carry on doing it even if youre very talented holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable that is the reason she has battled back from string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself will have as much commitment desire and energy to go through major championship holmes asked in the new year that is what dont know at holmes will also be aware that time is running out us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson five-time olympic gold_medallist retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britains double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesnt like the training anymore whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating double olympic champion will spur her opponents on holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten unless she is certain she has strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs the day after completing her double in athens the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as first gold at the world championships in helsinki there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldnt they be at least shared and celebrated you dont get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because its fantastic feeling think deep down kelly wants to run think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly_holmes tearing up the track again after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire so why is holmes dragging her heels about making decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again thats just kelly explains cram shes always been like that she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next she knows every time she makes pronouncement now its headline news kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line and if she decides not to run again no-one is going to turn round and say youre making the wrong decision

woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council led by lord_woolf published its proposals for england and wales it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity but that has now been changed to one-sixth with no reduction for those killers given whole life tariff at the time lord_woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty_pleas and co-operation he said but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord_woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said in statement issued on wednesday lord_woolf said have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines am confident as result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty_pleas is set down by parliament what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty_pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process it represents tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if guilty_plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said
